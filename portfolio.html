<p style="font-size:160%;">This was our first project 1.1.9 program which was called "Cake Factory", and what this program basically does is that the user can input how much layers 
they want the cake to be with the flavors assigned. They can also input the number of icing and candles which will be the decoration of the cake. 
The program will say too much candles if the user input too many candles compared to the radius of the cake. The picture above is an example of the cake with 6 layers, 
flavors of strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla, 4 candles, and 14 icings. We used the turtle method in VS Code to program.</p>

<p style="font-size:160%;">This is our second project 1.2.5 program which was whacking the minions that comes out at any of random 6 holes, adding point everytime we whack a minion, 
	and then at the end, showing the leaderboard showing top 5 high scorers. We used the rand method to randomize the location of the minion to either of 6 holes. 
	We had to versions of minions ready so the everytime you whack a minion, different minion appears, and hallowin theme background music to make the game more attractive. 
	We also designed and drew the minions and the background for the game.</p>

		screen. First, there is a spiderman action figure going across the screen, and when you click the action figure, 4 stuffed animals pops up and show positive messages 
		for the childrens.</p>

	<p style="font-size:160%;">This is our fourth project scratch program which was snake game. This game was inspired by snake game in google which you control the snake and as 
		the snake eats the apple that appears on the screen, the snake grows larger. Based on this idea, we made a snake game which you can control the snake, and whenever 
		the snake eats banana, the snake grows larger. The number of bananas captured is displayed as a point on the top left, and the game ends if the snake hit the wall.</p>
