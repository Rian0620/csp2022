<p style="font-size:160%;">This was our first project 1.1.9 program which was called "Cake Factory", and what this program basically does is that the user can input how much layers 
they want the cake to be with the flavors assigned. They can also input the number of icing and candles which will be the decoration of the cake. 
The program will say too much candles if the user input too many candles compared to the radius of the cake. The picture above is an example of the cake with 6 layers, 
flavors of strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla, 4 candles, and 14 icings. We used the turtle method in VS Code to program.</p>

	and then at the end, showing the leaderboard showing top 5 high scorers. We designed and drew the minions and the background for the game.</p>
